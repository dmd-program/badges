**Goals:**

The DMD Program is entirely online. This presents a challenge to maintain a sense of culture. We hope micro-credentials will:

- Increase student engagement with DMD Program's web presence
  - Provide moments for students to interact, explore, and discover
  - Reinforce digital design culture of program
  - Motivate students to want to learn supplemental content and skills
  - Increase sense of competition amongst students
- Automate micro-credentialing process to minimize workload for busy faculty
- Allow for transportability of credential information
  - Micro-credentials to appear on the DMD Program's hosted student portfolios
  - This portfolio will go with the students when they graduate, and so shall the credentials
  - Future-proof the credentials
